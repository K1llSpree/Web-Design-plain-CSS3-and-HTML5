                    <strong>Michael Joseph Jackson</strong> was an American singer, songwriter and dancer. Dubbed the
                    "King
                    of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a
                    four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance and fashion, along with his publicized
                    personal
                    life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music
                    genres;
                    through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk,
                    to
                    which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He is the most awarded music artist in history.

                <h2>Death of the king</h2>
                <br>
                <p>On June 25, 2009, less than three weeks before the first This Is It show was due to begin in London,
                    with all concerts sold out, Jackson died from cardiac arrest. Conrad Murray, his personal
                    physician, had given Jackson various medications to help him sleep at his rented mansion in Holmby
                    Hills, Los Angeles. Paramedics received a 911 call at 12:22 pm Pacific time (19:22 UTC), and arrived
                    three minutes later. Jackson was not breathing and CPR was performed.Resuscitation
                    efforts continued en route to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, and for more than an hour after
                    arriving there, but were unsuccessful, and Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm Pacific
                    time (21:26 UTC).</p>
